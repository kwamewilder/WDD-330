      <p>
        The Validating Forms reading helped me review client-side form
        validation.<br><br>
        We use client-side validation to ensure we get the right data, to
        protect user's data by making them create stronger passwords based on
        preset requirements and help protect then server from malicious requests
        from the client-side.<br><br>
        Server-side will require validation of it's own since client-side
        validation can be turned off.<br><br>
        Built-in form validation uses HTML form validation features.
        <br><br>
        JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. Everything needs to be
        created or use a library.<br><br>
        <u>Built-in form validation:</u><br>
        If a form element is valid, the element matches the :valid CSS
        pseudo-class. If not, it follows the :invalid CSS pseudo-class. These
        classes allow for specific styling.<br><br>
        If a form element contains a require attribute, the element matches the
        :required UI pseudo-class. If the element is empty, it matches the
        :invalid pseudo-class.<br><br>
        The textarea element does not support the pattern attribute.<br><br>
        <u>JavaScript form validation:</u><br><br>
        The
        <b
          ><a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation"
            >constraint validation API</a
          ></b
        >
        use form element DOM interfaces. The elements have several properties
        available for validation.<br><br>
        Validationg without a built-in API works best when we include answers to
        the following questions.<br>• What kind of Validation should I
        perform?<br>• What should I do if the form doesn't validate?<br>•
        What should I do if the form doesn't validate?<br><br>
        The Using Fetch reading helped me review the Fetch API.<br><br>
        The
        <b
          ><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch"
            >fetch</a
          ></b
        >
        method can accept a second parameter, init object, that allows control
        over different settings.<br><br>
        To send a request with credentials, we add "credentials:" to the init
        object where credentials is equal to include, same-origin and omit.<br><br>
        To post JSON-encoded data, use the post method inside the init object
        along with headers, content type and body information.<br><br>
        Uploading a file uses an HTML input element with a file type and the
        FormData method.<br><br>
        To upload multiple files, we use the same items as before but append
        items to dictionaries with key/value entries.<br><br>
        To check for successful responce from fetch, use the response.ok
        property.<br><br>
        Use the Request method or the clone method before the body of the
        original request or responce has already been read. Once a
        request/responce has been read, it is marked as read and will not be
        read again.<br><br>
        Use the Headers constructor to create your own headers. The headers
        object is a simple multi-map of names to values.<br><br>
        Header methods throw TypeErrors that will fail silently unless we use a
        catch statement to notify us when an error occurs.<br><br>
        Headers have guard properties set based on creation/called/responce. The
        default guard is none and the others are request, request-no-cors,
        responce and immutable(mostly used for ServiceWorkers).<br><br>
        Requests and responses contain body data, which is an instance of
        ArrayBuffer, TypedArray, DataView, Blob, File, String, URLSearchParams
        or FormData.<br><br>
        The same methods can extract the body from the request and responce.
        .arrayBuffer(), .blob(), .formData(), .json(), .text().
