      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        How often should we use a TDD framework like Jest?<br><br>
        Will we be using MVC for our mid and final checkin projects?
      </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        The Testing and Debugging reading was great to learn about different
        types of errors.<br><br>
        It was good to know what happens when there is a runtime error vs a
        warning. Knowing these two cases affect our JavaScript differently will
        help me know where I should be looking for errors.<br><br>
        I did not know about strict mode and how easy it is to implement into
        our JavaScript by simply adding 'use strict' in our first line of code
        or inside of a function (to use within the function). I will use this
        for JavaScript development to catch errors and follow best practices.<br><br>
        Feature detection was new to me and even though I knew some brwsers
        would not support what others can, I did not realize this could cause
        huge problems in our code.<br><br>
        I will be using the debugger keyword whenever possible when I want to
        track how data is flowing and changing.<br><br>
        The try block seems to work the same as the Python language try block
        with the difference being instead of using catch, it uses except. I use
        this all the time in Python apps so this will be straight forward in
        debugging on JavaScript.<br><br>
        Facebook's jest TDD framework seems to work similarly to the Python
        language py.test. I do not have much knowledge of this so I will need to
        find out more about jest and use it whenever I may need to test some
        code.<br><br>
