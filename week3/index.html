      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        What is the difference between how "this" works in Javascript vs how "self"
        works in Python?<br><br>
        When would you use nested objects?<br><br>
        Are there times you would want to change the default behavior of modifier keys?
      </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        The Objects Methods: this reading seems to be a review of Python
        classes. Both are Object-Oriented Languages and it seems that they work
        similarly.<br><br>
        It was good to see the examples for this at the end of the reading to
        help understand some of the limits/uses of this.<br><br>
        The Objects reading explains how objects work in JavaScript. It appears
        they work very similar to Python classes.<br><br>
        It is good to know we can use names for our object keys that don't
        follow the rules of naming variables by simply using quotes.<br><br>
        It is good to know that the hasOwnProperty() and Object.keys() methods
        will only check the object we are using to call that method rather than
        all of the objects it may be inheriting from.<br><br>
        I will have to go back and review some of the items in the RegExp
        section.<br><br>
        The Document Object Model reading was a lot of review from several
        things I learned in class and out last semester. There were a few new
        concepts that I will have to practice to make sure I retain the
        information, like the querySelector Method using document elements with
        id's and calling for specific child elements with their own classes or
        id's.<br><br>
        The Events reading was a great review for event listeners with lots of
        helpful examples. There were several new events for me to learn about
        and I will have to come back and review them later.<br><br>
        Not many notes this week.
