      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        When would we use a weak map?<br /><br />
        When would you use the arguments function?<br /><br />
        When/why would you hoist functions?<br /><br />
        Will we need to use Callbacks alot in our projects?
      </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        The Programming Basics reading was a great review for me. There are
        several items that were new to me like the charAt, indexOf, lastIndexOf,
        includes startsWith and endsWith methods for strings. Another new
        concept was the symbol primitive value. I also learned new methods for
        numbers and bitwise operators that I will also need to review.<br /><br />
        The Arrays, Logic, and Loops reading was also a great review and
        intruduced new information to me. Some of the new things are push,
        shift, unshift and from array methods. The spread operator was also a
        new array operator I was not aware of. Map data structures were
        completely new to me in JavaScript but I have used Dictionaries in
        Python so it should be fairly straight forward to learn. I will need to
        make sure to review this section.<br /><br />
        The ternary operator will be useful when using logic statements. I was
        not aware of this operator and I am glad I can use it to help shorten
        code.<br /><br />
        The arguments function is a new function I was not aware I could use.
        Although I can't think of when I would use it, I believe it would be a
        great way to make software that needs to adapt based on user input.<br /><br />
        Hoisting functions will be something for me to review. I prefer defining
        all functions before invoking them so this might be something I would
        have a need to use.<br /><br />
        Callbacks are new to me and can become confusing if too much information
        goes into them. I will need to review this if we frequently use it in
        assignments.<br /><br />
        Not many notes this week.
