      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Can we use both local storage and a database at the same time and is it
        best practice to use only one?
      </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        The story editor exercise was a great review for me. I remember a few
        sites using local storage and saving/getting information was not new to
        me. <br /><br />
        The Master Mobile UX video on Sitepoint did bring up something I had not
        thought about. I had no idea we should focus on mobile first when
        designing sites or apps. This will be helpful information when creating
        new tools for users. <br />
