      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Are forms something we should try to use when making mini games similar
        to the Quiz Ninja Projects?<br><br>
        What is the best way/industry standard for creating classes?<br><br>
        Why is monkey-patching frowned upon in JavaScript?<br><br>
        Do we need to install/use Node.js in this course?
      </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        The Forms reading was a great review of the basics of form attributes.
        It was great to learn how to get items from a form to the javascript
        code and prevent the form to post as normally intended.<br><br>
        The blur and change events were new, I will need to use these more in my
        forms whenever needed/possible.<br><br>The Object-Oriented
        Programming in JavaScript reading was a great review of the Programming
        with Classes course. There are many new things I will need to review
        from this chapter. Getting used to creating a class/finding the best way
        for me to create classes in JavaScript may take some time.<br><br>
        I will need to review the various object properties I can use.<br><br>
        It seems class declarations are better than constructor functions.<br><br>
        Something to remember is the prototype property is used to add/create
        new properties and methods that will stay the same for all instances of
        the class.<br><br>
        The defineProperty method will be something I might need to remember and
        use to make sure objects have their attributes set correctly.<br><br>
        Getter and Setters seem to be great tools in uppending values in our
        Objects/Classes. I will have to remember to use these sparingly.<br><br>
        Creating Objects from Objects can get confusing. I will need to come
        back and review this section.<br><br>
        I learned many things in the Modern Javascript Development reading. One
        of the things I enjoyed learning about was how to add items to an
        element without having to create many lines of code using JQuery.<br><br>
        I enjoyed learning about how to make our own libraries to use in our
        code.<br><br>
        It seems that it is better to default value the entire library so that
        when called, we do not need to use curly brackets and specify what we
        need.<br><br>
        I will have to dive deeper into a few of the MVC frameworks.
