        The Window Object reading helped me learned many new things about the
        Browser Object Model.<br><br>
        There is no ifficial standard for the BOM (Browser Object Model).<br><br>
        BOM only makes sense in a browser environment. Other environments such
        as Node.js will use global objects.<br><br>
        In browser environments BOM is called using the window object. It is
        best practice to not refer to this in code using window.variable but
        rather just the variable unless when needed for statements such as logic
        if statements.<br><br>
        The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program,
        display a message in a dialog box and return undefined, always.<br><br>
        The window.confirm method will stop the execution of the program,
        display a message in a confirmation dialog box with the options OK and
        Cancel. It returns a boolean, true for OK and flase for Cancel.<br><br>
        The window.prompt will stop the execution of the program, display a
        message in a dialog box with an input field and with options OK and
        Cancel. It return the text entry as a string if OK is selected or null
        if Cancel is selected.<br><br>
        Most browsers allow users to disable dialogs meaning we should not rely
        on them.<br><br>
        The window.navigator.userAgent properties will return information about
        the browser and OS being used. These can be modified by users meaning we
        should not rely on them.<br><br>
        The window.location property is an object that contains information
        about the URL of the current page. The location property has other
        properties that can be used to read/write/reload/redirect the URL
        contents.<br><br>
        The window.history property contains information about the current
        sessions previously visited pages.<br><br>
        The window.open method opens a new window and takes three paramaters,
        URL, title, list of attributes. This can be assigned to a variable.<br><br>
        The window.screen object contains information about the browser
        screen.<br><br>
        There is a limit of 20 cookies per domain. Each cookies can store up to
        4KB of information in the form of a text file that contains name/value
        pairs. Cookies can only be read by the a web page from the same domain
        that set them.<br><br>
        To create a cookie in Javascript we use the document.cookie property.
        Cookies can be reassigned values by using the same name and a different
        value. Cookies can be read using the property alone.<br><br>
        Cookies expire when the session ends by default. Adding "expires=" to
        the end of a cookie when it's set will allow the cookie to be saved
        longer. The value would be a UTC string format (Day, DD-Mon-YYY HH:
        MM:SS GMT). Instead of expires, we can use "max-age=" with a value in
        seconds (86400 secs = 1 day).<br><br>
        To delete a cookie, set the expire time to some time in the past.<br><br>
        The setTimeout method accepts a callback funtion and a time parameter in
        milliseconds to run the function. This returns an id and can be stopped
        by using the clearTimeout method with the id as a parameter.<br><br>
        The setInterval and clearInterval methods work the same as the timeout
        methods but will continue to call the function based on the time given.
        The set method can be set to a variable and the clear method can use the
        variable name as a parameter in place of an id.<br><br>
        The HTML5 APIs reading helped me learned several new things about
        APIs.<br><br>
        <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a> is a site to help check if
        a feature can be used.<br><br>
        The data- attribute is a way of embedding data into a page. This
        attribute is private to a page and can be used by calling data- followed
        by only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons and
        underscores. We have the option to include string values.<br><br>
        The data- values can be accessed using the dataset property followed by
        the name. Older browsers require getAttribute('data-name') instead.<br><br>
        The geolocation API can obtain the geographical location of the device.
        Because of privacy concerns, permission to use must be granted by the
        user first.<br><br>
        The geolocation API is a property of the navigator object and calls the
        getCurrentPosition method to get a position object of the device.<br><br>
        Web workers are what the name implies, they are workers that work in the
        background to process information that may take a long time or not.<br><br>
        To create a worker we use the Worker constructor function. For example
        const worker = new Worker('task.js'), this will open a file or send an
        error if it does not exist.<br><br>
        Websockets are a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a
        server.<br><br>
        The notification API allows us to show messages using the system's
        notifications. User permission is required before sending
        notifications.<br><br>
        An audio/video clip can be inserted into a page with the audio/video
        tags respectively and using the src attribute to point to the
        audio/video file. The controls attribute can be added to give display
        the browser's native controls.<br><br>
        Installed NodeJS and ran the server successfully. Did not upload files
        to gitHub since there are over 10K items inside of the parcel file.
