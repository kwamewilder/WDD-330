      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Will we be learning about 3D transforms?<br><br>
        What is the best way to know if our transforms/transitions will require
        vendor prefixing?<br><br>
        When would we use transitions vs animations and vice versa?<br><br>
        Is inkscape a safe place to download from? I am not sure if we will be
        creating our own SVG files but when trying to download from the link in
        the reading, my antivirus flagged the download.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        The Transforms and Transitions reading helped me learned many new things
        about manipulating elements on the page.<br><br>
        I have not dealt with translations before. This will be useful to create
        banners and general visual elements in a page.<br><br>
        Transforms do not cause a reflow. I will need to remember this when
        wanting to scale items.<br><br>
        I have not had to use rotation before but I can see this being a helpful
        tool to adding visuals to our pages.<br><br>
        Transform and transform-origin require prefixing. <br><br>
        Prefixing seems like it could be a bit challenging but doable.<br><br>
        Transition requires the -webkit- prefixing.<br><br>
        There is a list of properties that can be animated,
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties"
          >here.</a
        ><br><br>
        2 seconds/200 milliseconds is considered optimum time for a
        transition.<br><br>
        IE9 and older does not understand transitions.<br><br>
        The most common timing functions include ease, linear, ease-in,
        ease-out, and ease-in-out.<br><br>
        Transition-delay may be something to think about using when we don't
        want to visuals immediately after hovering and want to give the user
        some time to look over elements on the page.<br><br>
        Short hand transition declarations will save lines of code.<br><br>
        SUing the all keyword in transitions will transition all properties at
        the same rate, speed and delay.<br><br>
        Animation requires the -webkit- prefix.<br><br>
        Keyframes are snapshots that define a strting or end point of any smooth
        transition.<br><br>
        The animation name does not have quotes around it in either the property
        value or the @keyframes at-rule. As the specifications state the name is
        an identifier and not a string.<br><br>
        Animation-play-state will be helpful to ensure animations don't start
        from the beginning after pausing.<br><br>
        In the Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop reading, I learned many things
        about images.<br><br>
        Canvas API is not supported by older browser versions.<br><br>
        Canvas drawings are dreated in JavaScript. Because of this, we need to
        add the height and width in the HTML canvas tag. If not set, the default
        is 150 height x 300 width<br><br>
        Canvas coordinate system starts at the top left corner down to the
        bottom right.<br><br>
        strokeStyle draws a border. fillStyle fills path color. lineWidth is
        used to set the border width.<br><br>
        createLinearGradient x0 and y0 represent starting location. x1 and y1
        represent the end location.<br><br>
        Complex shapes require us to layout, stroke and fill the path.<br><br>
        beginPath() resets the default path to begin drawing a new shape.<br><br>
        arc(): arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise).<br><br>
        closePath() closes the path.<br><br>
        toDataURL method creates a URL with the image in it.<br><br>
        Reseting the width or height of a canvas will clear it.<br><br>
        To draw text, we need to set the fillStyle and textAlign methods and
        finally set the text using the fillText method. We can also add a font
        using the font property of the context object. To separate text to
        different lines, insert it at different y values.<br><br>
        SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics<br><br>
        XML: eXtensible Markup Language<br><br>
        SVG is an XML file format making it more accessible to search engines
        than canvas.<br><br>
