      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Is it bad practice to arrange the functions of an app in the order they
        are used in the app using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions
        rather than towards the top of the file?<br><br>
        How often are promises used in development?<br><br>
        Will we be setting up a local development server for the course?<br><br>
        Will we learn about/use XML files?
      </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        The Further Functions reading helped me learned many new things about
        functions in JavaScript.<br><br>
        I did not know functions had a length property.<br><br>
        The call and apply methods are great and I can see they would be great
        to use in web applications. I personally like the call method better
        than the apply but they are both great tools.<br><br>
        Cache objects that can store key/value information will be a great
        property to use in larger scale web apps.<br><br>
        When I work on a new web app, I try to group my functions near the top
        to make the flow of the program easier to follow. Using the Immediately
        Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) could change how I arrange my
        functions.<br><br>
        An IIFE is a single use function. I would only use this for functions
        that are required only once.<br><br>
        Functions that define and rewrite themselves could be useful when
        initializing an app. We could contain all needed startup code in this
        function and redefine it so nothing that was needed before can affect
        new functions/functionalities.<br><br>The video explianing event
        loops was great. It helped visualize how JavaScript runs.<br><br>
        Generators are great in storing information after the function has been
        completed. We could use this to remember important information like
        points in a game.<br><br>
        Keeping functions as pure as possible seems very important in many
        aspects but might not be possible in large scale apps.<br><br>
        The Ajax reading helped me learn more about APIs and how they work.<br><br>
        I will have to look into setting up a local development server to
        prepare for real world server-side development.<br><br>
        I have worked with JSON files and feel very comfortable with them. I
        will need to learn more about XML files.<br><br>
        The redirect method seems useful if we opened a new tab but it seems odd
        to redirect since the user would move to a new site page and all other
        code would be redundant since it would not be used after the page has
        been redirected. This may be why there is no support for it yet.
        <br><br>
        I will need to learn about blob objects. I do not know much about
        them.<br><br>
        I am most familiar with the JSON method when it comes to receiving
        responses from fetch API.<br><br>
        I am familiar with receiving information to an API but not sending to a
        database using Fetch API using the POST method.<br><br>
        The FormData interface is new to me and I will need to learn more about
        it. From what I learned it can help alot when dealing with file
        uploads.
